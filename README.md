# Characterize Service

This Assemblyline service partitions the file and calculates visual entropy for each partition.

**NOTE**: This service does not require you to buy any licence and is preinstalled and working after a default installation

## Execution

This service was meant to fully characterize the files submitted. Although as of now, it only splits the file in part an calculates the entropy of each part to generate a visual repesentation of the entropy.
